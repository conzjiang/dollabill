# dollabill
I decided to try my hand at implementing jQuery from scratch as a way to learn vanilla JS. However, through this exercise, I gained a much greater appreciation for jQuery now that I realize how much it really does for you!

## _dollabill_ DOM manipulation (dom_manip.js)
- `addClass`
- `removeClass`
- `toggleClass`
- `hasClass`
- `is`
- `html`/`empty`
- `first`
- `eq`
- `find`
- `parent`/`children`
- `closest`
- `append`
- `remove`
- `attr`
- `data`

## _dollabill_ events (events.js)
- `on`
- event delegation!

## Other _dollabill_ functionality
- `extend` (dollabill.js)
- `ajax` (ajax.js)

# TODO
- Allow for event namespacing
- Ideally, when appending, allow original reference to dollabill object to persist on the page somewhere
- Events#off - best way to handle turning off delegated events?
- Better organize event handlers
